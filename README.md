# Snowball Fight VR
## Description
A VR game where reaction time and precision determines your fate in a snowball fight. With three difficulties to choose from and an RNG based spawning system for the enemies, grab and dodge snowballs to avoid losing. Your left hand is used for grabbing snowballs that the snowmen shoot at you. If you manage to grab one, put it into the funnel of the snowball gun on your right hand. You'll need to load the snowball into the chamber with the grip button before you shoot it, and you have a counter on the gun to keep track of your ammo.
